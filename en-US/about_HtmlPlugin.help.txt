    Html Plugin

SYNOPSIS
    PScribo supports outputting hypertext markup language (.html) documents.

DESCRIPTION
    PScribo can output HTML documents for rendering in a web broswer.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
    There are some restrictions emposed by Html documents which means that some PScribo functionality cannot
    either be partially or fully implemented:

    - Html output attempts to create a document-like experience. Paper sizes, page breaks and headers/footers are
      rendered, but page numbers cannot be faithfully recreated.
    - Html output does not support the 'Dash' bullet style. Dashes will be rendered using the the web broswer's
      defaults.
    - Html numbered lists only support the default '.' number style terminator/suffix. The use of custom number
      style terminators/suffixes i.e. ')', is not supported.

PLUGIN OPTIONS
    The Html plugin accepts the following output customisation options:

        NoPageLayoutStyle [bool]    : Removes the page layout style and renders the content the full width of the
                                      browser window. If not specified, defaults to '$true'.

    Output customisations are passed to the Export-Document cmdlet as a hashtable, e.g.

    PS> $document | Export-Document -Format Html -Options @{ NoPageLayoutStyle = $true }
