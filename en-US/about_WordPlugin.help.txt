SYNOPSIS
    PScribo supports outputting Microsoft Word (.docx) documents.

DESCRIPTION
    PScribo can output Office Open XML (OOXML) documents for rendering with Microsoft Word 2013 (and later).

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
    There are some restrictions emposed by Word documents which means that some PScribo functionality cannot
    either be partially or fully implemented:

    - When opening documents that include a Table of Contents (TOC), Word displays a 'This document contains fields
      that may refer to other files.' warning message:
      - When the Word document is generated, page numbers are unknown. The 'updateFields' settings flag is used to
        instruct Word to update all field references, i.e. page numbers.
      - Selecting 'No' to this warning will render an empty Table of Contents
    - Whilst LibreOffice can open documents generated by PScribo, the following features are not currently
      implemented:
      - Table of Contents are not rendered as the 'updateFields' flag is not implemented/supported
      - Table cell font colors are not rendered correctly

PLUGIN OPTIONS
    The Word plugin does not accept any output customisation options.
